# About me

My name is Shuvam Das. I am from Kolkata West Bengal. I am pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering. I really am eager to get into our official robotics club ROBOISM.

## My division and my project

The division I chosed is Internet of Things an I decided to use the IoT concept for a fleet tracking Project. Basically my project is meant to provide a very cost effective way for fleet and vehicle tracking which can be used in vast fields like for tracking school buses and large mass of goods transportation vehicles and even for the crime forensic department to track crime scene vehicles. I tried to provide a simple system to provide the live location of a desired or a registered vehicle as the real time coordinates of the present live location of the vehicle on the embedded systm such that in this case the users registered mobile phone. 

### Brief explanation of my project

My project uses the basic feature of IOT i.e its connectivity and networking feature. Here I used very less components like a GPS and a GSM module and ofcourse the arduino uno. The arduino code has to be uploaded inside the users registered mobile number and he has to operate it through his phone's sms only. WWhen the user activates the live location of the registered vehicle the GPS comes into action and what happens is that it tries to fetch the original real time location such that the latitude and longitude of the current vehicle being operated and then the GPS feds the current raw data to the arduino uno and then arduino uno actually feds this data into systematic way of organised latitiude and longitude and then feeds this accurate organised data to the GSM module which also uses the basic feature of IOT that is connectivity and networking and sends this data to the users phone through a SMS and it also comes with a link in the message through which the user reaches the google map for a satellite view or a map view of the live location.

#### Further improvement 

For a very large scale program we can actually amplify the signal connectivity for the GPS and then we can get the live location of the large number of the vehicles directly and all at the same time together. We can even add a system to actually provide an alert message which would be sent to the organisations system controlling the whole system such that when there is  certain change in the route of th e registered vehicle such that they can track any discrepancies. For the crime forensics we can use this system to track a vehicles live location which has been abandoned and which has been used or is connected to some kind of crime We can aalso use this system to track any outside vehicke from other parts of the world that tries to breach into our country.

##### Conclusion 

I used powerpoint to create my slides and circuit.io to create my circuit diagram. I am not very much familiar with arduino coding but I am a fast learner and I am eager to learn it with from ROBOISM, so I took huge help of internet for the coding part but other than that I tried do everything by myself. I really hope to get selected for this wonderful club. Thank you for providing me this opportunity.
